# Interface Aggregater Helper

This repository contains a C# library designed to help you aggregate or combine multiple interfaces in your .NET projects. By using this package, you can more easily organize, maintain, and manipulate different interface implementations without writing repetitive glue code.

## Features

- Combine multiple interfaces into a single unified abstraction.
- Reduce boilerplate code when working with multiple interface implementations.
- Keep your code modular, clean, and maintainable.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Build the solution in your preferred IDE or via command line (e.g., `dotnet build`).
3. Reference the compiled assembly or NuGet package (if published) in your .NET project.

## Usage

1. Implement each interface in your classes or services.
2. Use the aggregator logic provided by the library to merge the interfaces into one cohesive object.
3. Access the combined functionalities without repetitive hand-written code.
